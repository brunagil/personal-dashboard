# Personal Dashboard 

The goal is to create a cute personal dashboard with a mind dump feature and extras that makes the space interesting to use. This was inspired by the codeacademy project called ["Inspirational Homepage](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/portfolio/inspirational-homepage)


### Project Requirements

- Build the application using React with Typescript 
- Start the project with Vite 
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project
- You can use any library you like
- Deploy application (suggestion: Netlify )


### Features (v1)

- Users can write down what's in their mind as a note (mind dump)
- Users can delete notes already posted 
- Users can click on a button or press backspace to post the note 
- Users receive a alert message when they try to post an empty note 

Extra 
- Users can check the current weather in their location
- Users are shown an inspirational quote of the day

### Features (v2)

### Visual 
- You can be creative with the UI of your project, but I would recommend to not use style libraries for now 
- You can draw your goal UI in paper, at Figma or any other tool
